## Code Journal

- I am still not fantastic at creating and knowing what needs to be added into the Vue components
- I think it's super easy and it makes sense to me, how to generate content staticly but it's not very useful when trying to make reusable components
- Started off by creating a new vue project'
- I grabbed some of the content we built the other day to help make things a little easier
- I had some issues viewing my content but it was because I forgot to add the `<BaseArticle />` to the App.vue file
- I tried to put my array of information into a different file and then pull it into another file but I forgot how to so I just put the array into the `<BaseArticle />`
- It was a bit confusing using the `v-for` but once you do it once and it works. You don't have to worry about it
- Tried adding Tailwindcss into the project but I could not figure out where I went wrong so to continue moving forward I just used `<style>` tags
- It's not a perfect website but it helps to better understand how to use Vue
